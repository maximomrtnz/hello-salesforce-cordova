Hello Salesforce Cordova
========================

Simple Project to investigate how to create a Cordova app that gather device information, and then, upload it to a Salesfor ORG using the forcetk.js library to help its task.

This simple project use the following Cordova Plugins. You have to install these, in order to use the app:

*org.apache.cordova.device
*org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser

Also this project use these following JavaScript libraries:

*forcetk.js
*mustache.js
*zepto.js

To give a better view I also use Bootstrap as a UI-Framework.
